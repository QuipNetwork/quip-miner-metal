//! Launch the v0.2 Metal SA / Gibbs kernels and score with consensus energy.
//!
//! Kernels are the original v0.2 Metal sources (`GPU/metal_kernels.metal` /
//! `GPU/metal_gibbs.metal`, copied verbatim into `kernels/`): int8-quantized
//! CSR, D-Wave incremental delta-energy SA / color-block Gibbs, bit-packed
//! thread-local state, one thread per read. The multi-spin kernel computes
//! energies on the device for whole-unit graphs, with one job in 1,000 audited
//! on the host. SA, Gibbs, and non-integer graphs are scored on the host with
//! [`quip_solver_core::quip_protocol::scoring::energy_milli`] (f64 consensus).
//!
//! # Batched dispatch (throughput)
//!
//! The kernel maps **one threadgroup per problem, one thread per read**
//! (`thread_id = threadgroup·num_reads + read`, `problem_id = thread_id /
//! num_reads`). A dispatch of `P` problems is
//! `dispatchThreadgroups(P, num_reads)` → `P` threadgroups occupy `P` GPU
//! cores, so a batch of ≈`gpu_cores` problems fills the whole GPU and hides
//! the kernel's thread-private memory latency. This mirrors v0.2
//! `metal_sa.py::_dispatch_batch`. Driving `P = 1` (one problem per command
//! buffer) leaves all but one core idle — a ~`gpu_cores`× slowdown — which is
//! why the streaming loop batches ([`crate::streaming`]).
//!
//! [`encode_batch`] builds one batch's buffers and encodes the dispatch without
//! committing; [`harvest_batch`] reads the bit-packed samples per problem. The
//! synchronous [`sample_ising`] runs a single-problem batch and waits.
